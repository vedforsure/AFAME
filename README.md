AFAME Internship Projects


Project 1: HR Data Analytics

Objective: To analyze and clean an HR dataset to prepare it for further insights and visualizations.

Key Steps and Methodologies:

Data Cleaning:
  1. NaN Values Handling: Systematically identified and removed all rows or columns with missing values to ensure the dataset's integrity.
  2. Column Selection: Filtered out columns with no variation (constant columns) which do not contribute to the analysis, optimizing the dataset for performance         and relevance.
Data Sorting and Visualization:
  1. Department-based Color Sorting: Organized the dataset by sorting employees according to their department, facilitating a clear visual representation.
  2. Color Coding: Applied color coding to different departments to enhance visual distinction during analysis and reporting.


Project 2: Titanic Survival Predictor
Objective: To build a predictive model that estimates the survival chances of passengers on the Titanic.

Key Steps and Methodologies:

  1. Data Splitling: Stratified Shuffle Split: The dataset was divided into two balanced parts based on the target variable (survival) to maintain proportional           representation of the classes.
  2. Training and Testing Split: Further divided the first part into training and testing sets to develop and evaluate the model.
  3. Algorithm Selection: Employed machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks (e.g., OneHotEncoder, Random Forest).
      Model Training: Trained the model using the training set, fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.
  4. Evaluation: Validated the model using the test set and achieved a prediction accuracy of 79%.

Final Testing: Applied the trained model to the second part of the dataset to predict survival outcomes.

Performance: Achieved an overall accuracy of 79% in predicting survival on the Titanic.
